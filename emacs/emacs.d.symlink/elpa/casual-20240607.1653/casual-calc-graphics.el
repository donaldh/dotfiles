The x-axis specification is typically a vector or an interval.
The y-axis specification can be either a vector or an algebraic
formula with a single independent variable, typically ùë•.

curve on the same canvas. The last curve generated is referred to
as the current curve. The user can invoke
`casual-calc--graph-juggle' to rotate to an arbitrary curve to
make it current.

The number of sample points used to plot a curve can be set by
calling `casual-calc--graph-num-points'."
