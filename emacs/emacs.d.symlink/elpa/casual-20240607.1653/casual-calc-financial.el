\nThe internal rate of return is defined as the discount rate

assess the likely profitability of a project or investment.
\nIRR assumes that cash flows occur regularly, in equal length time
periods. Cash flow values may vary between periods and represent
either income (positive) or expenditure (negative). At least one
value must be negative and at least one value must be positive.
