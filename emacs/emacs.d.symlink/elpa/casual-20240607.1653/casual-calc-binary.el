;; Wrapped Calc Functions

(defun casual-calc--calc-and ()
  "Computes the bitwise AND of the two numbers on the top of the stack.
\nStack Arguments:
2: a
1: b

This function is a wrapper over `calc-and'.

* References
- info node `(calc) Binary Functions'
- `calc-and'"
 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-and))

(defun casual-calc--calc-or ()
  "Computes the bitwise inclusive OR of two numbers.
\nStack Arguments:
2: a
1: b

This function is a wrapper over `calc-or'.

 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-or))

(defun casual-calc--calc-xor ()
  "Computes the bitwise exclusive OR of two numbers.

 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-xor))

(defun casual-calc--calc-diff ()
  "Computes the bitwise difference of two numbers.
\nStack Arguments:
2: a
1: b

This is defined by ‘diff(a,b) = and(a,not(b))’, so that
‘diff(2#1100, 2#1010) = 2#0100’.

This function is a wrapper over `calc-diff'.

* References

(defun casual-calc--calc-not ()
  "Computes the bitwise NOT of a number.
\nStack Arguments:
1: n

A bit is 1 if the input bit is 0 and vice-versa.

This function is a wrapper over `calc-not'.

- info node `(calc) Binary Functions'
- `calc-not'"
 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-not))

(defun casual-calc--calc-rshift-arith ()
  "Arithmetic shift right by one bit.
\nStack Arguments:
1: n

This command performs an “arithmetic” shift to the right, in
which the leftmost bit (according to the current word size) is
duplicated rather than shifting in zeros. This corresponds to
dividing by a power of two where the input is interpreted as a
signed, twos-complement number. (The distinction between the
‘binary’ and ‘arithmetic’ operations is totally independent from
whether the word size is positive or negative.)

This function is a wrapper over `calc-rshift-arith'.

 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-rshift-arith))

(defun casual-calc--calc-rotate-binary ()
  "Rotates a number one bit to the left.
\nStack Arguments:
1: n

The leftmost bit (according to the current word size) is dropped
off the left and shifted in on the right.

This function is a wrapper over `calc-rotate-binary'.

* References
- info node `(calc) Binary Functions'
- `calc-rotate-binary'"
 (interactive)
 (call-interactively #'calc-rotate-binary))

(defun casual-calc--calc-word-size ()
    "Set the word size from a prompt.

This command displays a prompt with the current word size; press
<RET> immediately to keep this word size, or type a new word size
at the prompt. Default word size is 32.

This function is a wrapper over function `calc-word-size'.
