(defun casual-calc--calc-curve-fit ()
  "Fit a set of data (‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors of numbers) to an equation.
\nThis command attempts to fit a set of data (‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors
of numbers) to a straight line, polynomial, or other function of ‘x’.
\nStack Arguments:
1: [[<x data>] [<y data>]]

Both the vectors of <x data> and <y data> are of equal length.

This command issues two prompts in succession:
1. The model to fit the data to.
2. Variable(s) used to represent the model.

By default this command chooses high letters like ‘x’ and ‘y’ for
independent variables and low letters like ‘a’ and ‘b’ for
parameters.  (The dependent variable doesn't need a name.)  The two
kinds of variables are separated by a semicolon.  Since you
generally care more about the names of the independent variables
than of the parameters, Calc also allows you to name only those
and let the parameters use default names.

* Model Types
- ‘1’   Linear or multilinear.  a + b x + c y + d z.
- ‘2-9’ Polynomials.  a + b x + c x^2 + d x^3.
- ‘e’   Exponential.  a exp(b x) exp(c y).
- ‘E’   Base-10 exponential.  a 10^(b x) 10^(c y).
- ‘x’   Exponential (alternate notation).  exp(a + b x + c y).
- ‘X’   Base-10 exponential (alternate).  10^(a + b x + c y).
- ‘l’   Logarithmic.  a + b ln(x) + c ln(y).
- ‘L’   Base-10 logarithmic.  a + b log10(x) + c log10(y).
- ‘^’   General exponential.  a b^x c^y.
- ‘p’   Power law.  a x^b y^c.
- ‘q’   Quadratic.  a + b (x-c)^2 + d (x-e)^2.
- ‘g’   Gaussian.  (a / b sqrt(2 pi)) exp(-0.5*((x-c)/b)^2).
- ‘s’   Logistic _s_ curve.  a/(1 + exp(b (x - c))).
- ‘b’   Logistic bell curve.  a exp(b (x - c))/(1 + exp(b (x - c)))^2.
- ‘o’   Hubbert linearization.  (y/x) = a (1 - x/b).

polynomial divided by a polynomial) is acceptable.  (Rational
functions don't have to be in explicit quotient form, however;
‘x/(1+x^-2)’ is not strictly a quotient of polynomials, but it is
