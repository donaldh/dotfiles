The goal of this package is to provide a simple interface for commonly used
govc commands within Emacs.  This includes table based inventory/state modes
for vms, hosts, datastores and pools.  The keymap for each mode provides
shortcuts for easily feeding the data in view to other govc commands.

Within the various govc modes, press `?' to see a popup menu of options.
A menu bar is enabled for certain modes, such as `govc-vm-mode' and `govc-host-mode'.
There is also a `govc' menu at all times under the `Tools' menu.

The recommended way to install govc.el is via MELPA (http://melpa.org/).
